# Hand_Written_Digit_Classification_CNN
model which can identify the handwritten digits by classifying them using convolutional neural networks <br/>
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision.

## DATASET
• the data consists of hand written digits ranging from 1 to 9. each of these hand written digits varies from one another<br/>
• The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The     digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.<br/>
•The data is stored in a very simple file format designed for storing vectors and multidimensional matrices. <br/><br/>

<br/>

## METHODOLOGY<br/>
• preprocessing- reshaping and normalizing the images.<br/>
• building the convolutional neural network.<br/>
• compiling training and evaluating the model.<br/>
